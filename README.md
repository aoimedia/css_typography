This article/tutorial covers the basic stuff and some neat tricks.
* **Basic Size:** font-size of 16 pixels (currently the standard size of most User Agent Stylesheets) and very readable on most screens.
* **Measure (line length):** 45 - 75 characters for readability.
* **Leading (line height):** 140% of font-size.
	* with continuous copy, use large leading;
    * with light text on dark background, use large leading;
    * with long line lengths, use large leading;
    * with large x-height, use large leading;
    * with short burst of information, use small leading.
* **The magic number:** The pixel value for your line height will now be your magic number. This number means everything to your design. All line heights and margins will be this number or multiples thereof. I find it useful to always keep it in mind and stick to it.
